    <H1>Pros & Cons of an Equal Interval Map</H1>
    <H3>I used a ratio of 10 thousands just because it was easier to divide the data that way. The problem with that it makes it harder to find outliers.</H3>
    <H2>Pros: It is very easy to interpret. Allows the Map to be Simplfied </H2>
    <H2>Cons: It does not take into consideration how data is distrubted along a number line</H2>

    <H1>Pros & Cons of an Equal Count Map</H1>
    <H2>Pros: It represents everyone equally, but this can also be a con. Have to make sure data type fits the equal count in order to be a succesful map</H2>
    <H2>Cons:It can create a group for outliers, therefore just by looking at the map you wouldn't be able to tell. </H2>

    <H1>Pros & Con of Logarithmic Map</H1>
    <H2>Pros:It is very easy to be able to compare data just by looking at the map. It can also cover large datasets. </H2>
    <H2>Cons: Won't be able to find outliers easily. </H2>
